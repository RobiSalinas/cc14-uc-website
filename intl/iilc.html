        <p>In line with its continuous pursuit to generate new knowledge and innovative technology that are geared
          towards the development of relevant and technical higher-order skills needed to compete in the knowledge
          economy, the University of the Cordilleras (UC) is committed to strengthening its internationalization
          competitiveness.</p>

        <p>The university believes that to help in the realization of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the
          Philippines' AmBisyon Natin 2040, and the ideals of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it
          needs to assume a more active stance in producing graduates who are locally committed, globally engaged, and
          are ready to take on the demands of today's globalized world.</p>

        <p>Internationalization has been one of the top priorities of UC. Internationalization is embedded in all the
          key results area in the University's current strategic plan. For instance, in the key results area on
          education, the university is working towards the enhancement of the global skills and competence of its
          faculty through mobilization programs in the form of faculty exchange, acceptance of visiting professors and
          experts, strengthening of research collaboration programs with foreign institutions, and attendance in
          international training and conferences, among others.</p>

        <p>International partnership agreements and external grants have enabled the University to send faculty members,
          staff, and students to various academic programs, training, conferences, and events in countries like the
          United States, Canada, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, China, and Malaysia. The said academic mobility
          initiatives have been very beneficial to the UC community. Upon their return to UC, the grantees were able to
          share their experiences with their colleagues, conduct impactful projects and programs, and initiate policy
          reforms that are inspired by the new learning experiences and exposure they have acquired abroad.</p>

        <p>In 2020, the UC Institute for Innovative Learning and International Cooperation (UC-IILIC) was created to
          lead in the realization of the University's collective long-term vision and aspirations towards the
          internationalization of its academic programs and services.</p>

        <p>The UC-IILIC is an administrative office under the Office of the President and is the office primarily
          responsible in dealing with international partners and in designing, developing, and delivering meaningful and
          sustainable transnational collaborative programs.</p>
