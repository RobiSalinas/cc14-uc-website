          <p>One of the most enduring and successful extracurricular programs of the University is its athletic varsity
            program. Fielding top-caliber teams for inter-school sports meet and even international competitions; the
            University of the Cordilleras (UC) occupies one of the higher tiers for athletic programs in the city of
            Baguio and in the Northern Luzon. Sportsmen bearing the school colors have instilled a deep sense of pride
            not
            only for the students and the entire UC community as evidenced by many championships it had won in many team
            and individual sports. But this pride also resonates throughout the city and the Northern Luzon region
            because
            of the UC varsity's success in more international events, culminating in the victories of UC Varsity players
            during the Beijing Wushu Olympics 2008 competitions.</p>
