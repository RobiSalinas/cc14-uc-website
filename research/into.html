          <h2>About</h2>

          <p>The University of the Cordilleras Innovation and Technology Transfer Office (UC INTO) was established under
            the Intellectual Property Management Program for Academic Institutions Commercializing Technologies (IMPACT)
            Program of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in November of 2020. The University was screened
            to undergo training under the United States Agency International Development- Science, Technology, Research
            and Innovation for Development (USAID- STRIDE) Program. The USAID STRIDE program's goal is to strengthen the
            science, technology, research, and innovation capacity in Philippine higher education, focusing on
            disciplines that contribute to high-growth economic sectors. With this, the grant has been conferred to the
            University of the Cordilleras, one of the top 10 qualifiers for the IMPACT Program.</p>

          <p>The UC-INTO, under the Vice President for Academics and Research, is responsible for the implementation of
            the IP and the Tech Transfer Policies of the University through assisting the employees, students, and
            partners in commercializing technology created and developed at UC. In doing so, the INTO strives to
            contribute to the public good, further economic development in the region, and enhance the research and
            development reputation of the University.</p>
