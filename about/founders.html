              <div>
                <p>To mark the 100th anniversary of the Co-Founder of the University, Evangelina D. Salvosa, UC formally
                  named the UC College of Nursing Building as the EDS Building on 12 July 2010.</p>
                <p>This is to honor the enduring contribution of Evangelina D. Salvosa in the evolution of the
                  University
                  as a beacon of higher education in these mountain highlands of the Cordillera.</p>
                <p>Evangelina D. Salvosa is a 1932 graduate of University of the Philippines, Philippine General
                  Hospital,
                  School of Nursing, having completed the 4-year Graduate Nursing (G.N.) program of the UP-PGH. EDS
                  subsequently passed the state licensure examinations for Nurses and started her practice of Nursing at
                  the Philippine General Hospital. EDS then moved on to become Head Nurse at the Cebu General Hospital.
                </p>
                <p>The qualities of professional practicing nurses are usually universally underestimated. But parallel
                  to
                  their low, almost invisible profile, practicing nurses keep a keen, constant eye on sanitation, and
                  are
                  in a perpetual state of readiness to provide the logistics and remedial measures in emergencies and
                  contingencies. The impact of EDS at UC is manifested in two distinctly nursing ways : 1.) the
                  'in-depth', 'spic-and-span' cleanliness of the university premises, from the top-down, from
                  floor-to-ceiling ; and 2.) in the prevailing mindset of its top management team, to remain steady, in
                  control, organized and ready-to-act during times of crisis.</p>
                <p>A woman of mature and serene equanimity, who, in her hallmark quiet composure, loomed as a rock of
                  stability and swayed the university community in the same magnitude as UC's Founder, BRS.</p>

                <p class="h1 text-center">The University of the Cordilleras</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Intro -->
              <div>
                <p>The City of Baguio has grown, developed and blossomed into a notable regional center of education of
                  the country, &#8212; from its charter date as a city in September 9, 1909, &#8212; up to today, 112
                  years
                  later.</p>

                <p>The University of the Cordilleras has evolved into an institution that is vibrant, significant, and
                  relevant to the life and times of the nation; &#8212; from its founding date of June 19, 1946, &#8212;
                  up
                  to
                  today, its 75th school year.</p>

                <p>Having logged 75 school years as an institution of higher learning, UC remains ever grateful to its
                  home, the City of Baguio and to the Cordillera region.</p>

                <p>UC is indeed privileged to serve the nation as a beacon of higher education, blessedly situated in a
                  mountain highlands setting; &#8212; Baguio City, in the heart of the Cordillera region.</p>

                <p>Indeed, a day does not go in UC without serving a cue to its university community &#8212; of the
                  institutional calling &#8212; <i>to serve and to give back</i>, &#8212; in terms of university
                  resources
                  and
                  outreach, &#8212; to its home community and region &#8212; the City of Baguio and the Cordillera.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- This is Who we are -->
              <div>
                <p class="h2">This is Who We Are</p>

                <p>"To Serve" and "To Give Back" constitutes the "DNA," or the genetic imprint of the University of the
                  Cordilleras.</p>

                <p>The source of these "genes" can be traced to the enduring vision and legacy of the Founders of UC. In
                  investing assets in Baguio Colleges Inc. in 1946, UC's Founders deemed it then as high honor, their
                  being granted the privilege of educating the youth of the land. Thus, as an embodiment of the honor
                  and respect that they held in having been entrusted with such privilege, &#8212; they committed the
                  original capital they invested in the school as a permanent investment; subsequently allocating for
                  the benefit of the institution, all the earnings thereon.</p>

                <p>Thus in 1967, at the 21st school year of the institution, UC's Founders substantiated their
                  intentions to consider the school as beyond proprietary interests. They initiated a re-organization of
                  Baguio Colleges Inc. They formed in its place, a Foundation. They then donated their corporate and
                  personal assets to the Baguio Colleges Foundation, the entity which has evolved into the University of
                  the Cordilleras of today.</p>

                <p>In effect, UC's Founders decided, willfully and voluntarily, "to give it all back," unconditionally
                  and in perpetuity. This they executed by signing an irrevocable deed of donation. In doing so, UC's
                  founders transformed the trajectory of the institution.</p>
              </div>

              <!-- Nothing Taken Out -->
              <div>
                <p class="h2">Nothing Taken Out; Every Resource Reinvested</p>

                <p>This is the vision and the legacy that governs UC today: Each school year, UC invests and continues
                  to re-invest all its revenue and earnings back to the institution and its pursuit of its core mission.
                </p>

                <p>As a consequence of this initiative by its Founders, UC took on the character of an organization that
                  conducts its business without the pressure of serving the interests of shareholders or the "bottom
                  line."</p>

                <p>Having statutorily relinquished ownership, UC's founders unleashed the energy and resources of the
                  organization solely towards the upgrading of university standards. The intent is that &#8212; this
                  "game plan" would ensure an unerring path towards excellence, fueled by the deployment of the
                  university's resources bearing down fully on the university's academic degree, research and community
                  extension programs.</p>

                <p>Having voluntarily relinquished the ownership benefits thereon, the fruit of corporate operations,
                  thus, would gravitate and inure, as a natural consequence, to its core mission of opening platforms of
                  educational opportunity to the university constituency &#8212; i.e., the students, the faculty, the
                  staff, the parents, the alumni and ultimately, &#8212; the city and the region; &#8212; and the nation
                  and society in general.</p>

                <p>The management successors of UC's Founders therefore, while inheriting corporate control over the
                  university, have thus been transformed from their traditional role of shareholders to that of faithful
                  stewards of UC's vision of the application of altruism towards its educational mission.</p>

                <p>Today, UC strives to shun any semblance of becoming "an ivory tower"; isolated and oblivious to the
                  concerns and conditions of its country, its home community and region.</p>
              </div>

                <p class="h2">Our Intentions</p>

                <p>Upon the altruistic platform forged by the founder's intentions hereon, we intend to substantiate
                  their vision and legacy in concrete terms: through human development projects, specific and general,
                  conducted within the span of operations of the school.</p>

                <p>This we commit and pledge, with deep humility; and also, with an abiding respect for the indomitable
                  spirit of the proud people of these mountain highlands, acknowledging our obligation to foster
