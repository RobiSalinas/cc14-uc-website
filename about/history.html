    <div class="mb-5">
      <div>
        <p>Baguio Colleges, as the University of the Cordilleras was earlier known, pioneered in tertiary education in
          the
          mountain highlands of the Cordillera region amidst devastation in and around Baguio City after the Second
          World
          War.</p>

        <p>Despite a pessimistic outlook and the bleak prospects pervading the climate of any undertaking at that time,
          Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa envisioned Baguio City as a university town. With such vision, he undauntedly
          pursued
          a noble mission by founding a college.</p>

        <p>It was on June 19, 1946, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, that a historic event
          unfolded. Baguio Colleges was established initially offering courses in teacher training and liberal arts,
          with
          the first batch of enrollees consisting of 156 students. Classes were first held in rented spaces at the
          Antipolo building, and later, at the Lopez and Lamping buildings along Session Road, the city's main
          thoroughfare.</p>

        <p>1966 became a turning point for Baguio Colleges as it was converted into an educational foundation. Since
          then,
          it has blazed new trails and has become more responsive to the needs of the time.</p>

        <p>The founder, Atty. Benjamin R. Salvosa sat as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and held the reins of the
          presidency up to the early part of 1994.</p>
